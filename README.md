# cs181-final-project
My Final Project for CS181 (Data Systems). Much more polished than my Mid-Term Project, but the notebook here takes longer to scrape all the data we need. This project scrapes some data off of formula1.com to figure out who the fastest driver on the grid has been over some set of years. It scrapes data off the web into .html files, parses them using lxml, builds a database using all the data and then uses this database to tell us who has been the fastest.
